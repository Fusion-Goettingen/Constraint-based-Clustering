# Constraint-based-Clustering

Code to integrate cluster-level constraints into the hierarchical clustering algorithm HDBSCAN will be added soon. 

The application of a distance threshold as described in our paper [A Hybrid Approach To Hierarchical Density-based Cluster Selection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9235263) is already integrated into the existing [Python implementation by McInnes et al.](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan), see the [documentation](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan).
